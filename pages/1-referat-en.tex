The subject of the graduate qualification work is ``Development of a mobile navigation application on the iOS platform''.

The given work is devoted to the development of a mobile application on the iOS platform, which displays indoor and outdoor map, and also allows the user to search the map and build a route to points of interest.
The research set the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Analyze existing technologies to solve this problem
  \item Develop a technique for highly detailed cartography and use it to map
  \item Develop a mobile application that will display a map and provide the user with a search and build a route along it
  \item Develop the ability to "share"\ route using graphic codes
\end{itemize}

The campus of the Polytechnic University was chosen as the object of cartography, its orthomosaic map was compiled, according to which cartography was carried out in the IMDF format. A mobile application was developed to display the map on the iOS platform that supports all current devices. The AppClip technology is integrated into the application, making the ability to share the route is fully revealed.

The developed application will be relevant for students who want to find an office in an unfamiliar building, as well as for organizers who can put a link or a QR code on the route to the event venue in the invitation.
